**Abstract**

In this study, we present an advanced analysis aimed at understanding landslide risks in Puerto Rico due to earthquakes, focusing on the critical roles of rock types, slope steepness, and peak ground velocities (PGV). Puerto Rico, positioned at the interaction of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates, provides a unique setting to explore how seismic activities influence landslide occurrences. By applying the innovative approach by Nowicki Jessee et al. (2018), we combined detailed geological, topographical, and vegetation data with PGV records from recent earthquakes. Our method blends on-the-ground surveys, aerial imagery, and complex statistical analyses to predict which areas are most at risk of landslides. The results reveal a clear link between the studied factors and the likelihood of landslides, offering new insights into predicting and managing these natural hazards. This study not only improves our ability to forecast landslides with greater accuracy but also provides a practical guide for enhancing disaster preparedness and implementing effective prevention strategies. Thus, our work contributes valuable knowledge for managing earthquake-induced landslide risks, serving as a model for similar regions around the world facing these challenges.

# Introduction

Puerto Rico, a region profoundly influenced by its intricate geological and seismic profile, serves as a critical case study for analyzing natural hazards within the Caribbean. This territory, situated at the juncture of the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates, is inherently prone to a spectrum of seismic activities, from subtle tremors to profound earthquakes. Such seismic dynamics significantly heighten the propensity for slope instabilities, leading to landslides that threaten the integrity of infrastructure [@monroeMapShowingLandslides1979]. The events of the 2020 southwestern Puerto Rico earthquakes have starkly highlighted the exigency of evaluating landslide susceptibility under seismic influences.


Few landslide susceptibility studies exist for Puerto Rico, and only four have mapped susceptibility island-wide [@hughesMapDepictingSusceptibility2020; @kamalDevelopmentLandslideHazard2008; @leporeRainfallinducedLandslideSusceptibility2011; @monroeMapShowingLandslides1979]. 
@monroeMapShowingLandslides1979 categorized landslide susceptibility into areas of low, moderate, high, and highest susceptibility (including at the time recent and active slides). However, at that time, parts of western Puerto Rico had not yet been geologically mapped and @monroeMapShowingLandslides1979 was not able to distinguish between earthquake or rainfall as the primary trigger. The susceptibility studies by @hughesMapDepictingSusceptibility2020, @kamalDevelopmentLandslideHazard2008, and @leporeRainfallinducedLandslideSusceptibility2011 only considered rainfall-triggered landslides caused by intense and prolonged rainfall. Similarly, @larsenMapShowingSusceptibility2004 and @larsenMapShowingLandslide2020 produced regional rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility maps for Ponce and Comerio, respectively. 

Locations of landslides triggered by earthquakes can significantly differ from rainfall-triggered susceptibility maps [@allstadtGroundFailureTriggered2022; @hughesMapDepictingSusceptibility2020]. Understanding the seismic genesis of landslides and to accurately assess slope failures, a synthesis of geotechnical, spatial, and historical analyses is required. @santiagoMapShowingSusceptibility2001 developed a landslide susceptibility map of the San Juan Metropolitan Area (SJMA) using the classification scheme of the @federalemergencymanagementagencyHazusEarthquakeModel2022 Hazus Earthquake Technical Manual which was based off the relationship proposed by @wilsonPredictingArealLimits1985.  @ramirez-riveraEarthquakeLossEstimation2016 used the same methodology to generate a landslide susceptibility map of Mayagüez, in combination with data from @monroeMapShowingLandslides1979 map and the @bawiecGeologyGeochemistryGeophysics1998 geologic map of Puerto Rico. The landslide susceptibility was measured on a scale of I to X, with I being the least susceptible depending on the lithology and slope angle. 

The @wilsonPredictingArealLimits1985 framework categorizes lithology into strongly cemented rocks (crystalline rocks and well-cemented sandstone), weakly cemented rocks and soils (sandy soils and poorly cemented sandstone), and argillaceous rocks (shales, clayey soil, existing landslides, and poorly compacted fills), and susceptibility rises in conjunction with slope angle and the groundwater condition (at ground surface or below level of slide). In an geologically diverse landscape like Puerto Rico, this classification scheme is limited in its capacity to capture the subtle complexities that determine susceptibility. More difficulty arises with the inclusion of groundwater condition as a factor because there are only 20 USGS monitoring wells located on the main island, and one more on the outlying island of Vieques. These issues are not unique to @wilsonPredictingArealLimits1985 because global models such as @hartmannNewGlobalLithological2012 and @nadimGlobalLandslideAvalanche2006 were made to generalize for practical application of the model within a given time frame for stakeholder. 

Modern landslide susceptibility mapping frameworks generally utilize logistic regression to determine spatio-temporal probability of landsliding, i.e. landslide hazard, and slope and aspect are typically included as covariates determine landslide susceptibility, while excluding less important factors [@budimirSystematicReviewLandslide2015]. Inventories on the location and spatial extent of rainfall-triggered landslides are widely available because the high frequency of intense rainfall events, such as Hurricane Maria (September 2017) which triggered 70,000 landslides in Puerto Rico alone [@hughesMapDepictingSusceptibility2020]. In a review by @suzenEvaluationEnvironmentalParameters2012, there were at least 18 different factors used to assess landslide hazard or susceptibility in 145 studies, which were grouped into four major types: environmental (e.g. rainfall, landcover, etc.), geotechnical (e.g. soil texture and thickness), topographical (e.g. drainage, roughness, slope, etc.), and geological (faults, lithology, strata-slope interaction) [@budimirSystematicReviewLandslide2015]. The predictive model used by the USGS is based off the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 study, which isolated the key determinants of landslide susceptibility including (1) seismic intensity in the form of peak ground velocity (PGV), (2) slope gradient, (3) lithological characteristics, (4) land cover, and a (5) soil wetness measure such as the compound topographic index (CTI). @allstadtGroundFailureTriggered2022 conducted a ground failure study after the 2020 earthquake, collecting an inventory of 338 landslide sites in the south. At the regional level, the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model overestimated total hazard area by six times durng the 2020 event, with most landslides occurring in areas where the probability was 0.5% [@allstadtGroundFailureTriggered2022]. Slight adjustments in modeling approach and improvements in the quality of data inputs can improve the performance of the model at a regional scale. The @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model is to this study is the  posited by  (Equations \ref{eq:nowickiLogit} - \ref{eq:nowickiPT}). 

With the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model, probability of landsliding can be predicted using a linear combination of individual predictor variables that can be expressed in a set of logistic functions:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nowickiLogit}
  Logit(P) = \ln\left(\frac{P}{1 - P}\right) = t,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nowickiT}
  t = a + b * \ln(PGV) + c * slope + d * lithology + \newline
  e * land cover + f * CTI + g * \ln(PGV) * slope,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nowickiPT}
  P(t) = \frac{\exp(t)}{1 + \exp(t)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-t)}, 
\end{equation}

\noindent
Where $a$,$b$,$c$,$d$,$e$,$f$ and $g$ are coefficients solved for within the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model. 

The overarching goal is to develop a high-resolution predictive product for landslide susceptibility in Puerto Rico using the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model. By advancing the granularity of our understanding of landslide dynamics in response to seismic stimuli, this study aspires to fortify Puerto Rico’s resilience against such inevitable natural adversities, ensuring a proactive posture in landslide risk anticipation and management. Such a model not only advances our scientific understanding of landslide dynamics but also serves as a crucial tool for disaster risk management, land-use planning, and the development of mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable communities. Through this research, we contribute to a safer and more resilient Puerto Rico, where the risks of seismically induced landslides are understood, anticipated, and managed.

# Methodology

## Study Region

Puerto Rico, along with the Virgin Islands and eastern Hispaniola, exist on a microplate in an active plate boundary zone that lies between the westward-moving North America Plate and the eastward-moving Caribbean Plate, marked by the Anegada Trough and Muertos Trough to the south and the Puerto Rico Trench to the north [@oloughlinCaribbeanTsunamis500year2003]. There are complex motions occurring between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, where to the south, in Mona Passage and Mona Canyon, there is extension and oblique thrusting, while possible strike-slip motion is happening in the Puerto Rico Trench (@mercadoNumericalSimulation19181998; Fig. 3). The interpolate motion, running parallel of the Puerto Rico Trench, averages two meters per century and slow subduction zones can generate interpolate-thrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis [@atwaterEffects2010Hurricane2014]. Mona Canyon is the location of the most important tsunamigenic sources near northwestern Puerto Rico, where the sea floor lies more than 2 km lower than its surrounding due extensional tectonics which has caused the down dropping of large blocks of the inner wall of the trench, resulting in the development of normal faults [@mercadoNumericalSimulation19181998].

## Software

The geospatial processing procedures were completed with the R statistical language
[@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023a] using spatial toolsets such as the *terra* and *tidyterra* packages [@hernangomezUsingTidyverseTerra2023; @hijmansTerraSpatialData2023]. Polygon drafting and editing was done in the QGIS geographic information system software [@qgisdevelopmentteamQGISGeographicInformation2024].

## Model Inputs

### Peak Ground Velocity (PGV)
Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) measures the maximum speed at which the ground moves at a location during an earthquake, typically expressed in terms of distance per unit time. It is a critical parameter in seismology and earthquake engineering, indicating the intensity of ground motion and its potential to cause structural damage and induce landslides. PGV is used alongside peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration (SA) in seismic hazard analysis to characterize expected ground shaking, informing the design of earthquake-resistant structures and mitigation strategies. High PGV values are associated with increased risk of severe structural damage and slope failures, making accurate PGV estimation vital for risk assessments, building codes, and the development of earthquake preparedness measures. The PGV modeled for three historical earthquake scenarios were used by @ramirez-riveraEarthquakeLossEstimation2016 to estimate earthquake loss; these included the M7.5 Mona Canyon earthquake of 1918, the M7.5 Virgin Island Basin (VIB) earthquake of 1867, and the M~8.0 event that occurred offshore the northern coast of Puerto Rico on May 2, 1787 [@doserHistoricalEarthquakesPuerto2005]. Specified fault geometry and magnitude of the earthquake scenarios from estimates of i) fault dimensions, ii) intensity map, and iii) ground motion were obtained by @ramirez-riveraEarthquakeLossEstimation2016 from the literature [@huerfanoSusceptibilidadPuertoRico2003; @mercadoNumericalSimulation19181998; @zahibo1867VirginIsland2003]. The maximum PGV possible at a given location was used for the analysis. This was grouped into equal intervals ranging from 0-5 and >50 cm/s, each assigned a landslide susceptibility score between zero and 10, from none to very high.

### Terrain Analysis
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are pivotal in landslide susceptibility analysis, through precise slope gradient calculations and hydrological modeling. DEMs delineate steep terrains at heightened landslide risk and areas susceptible to water-induced soil destabilization. By integrating DEMs with geotechnical data, researchers can quantitatively assess erosion dynamics and structural stability of landforms. The SRTM15+ global bathymetry and topography (15-arc sec resolution) for Puerto Rico was downloaded using the *elevatr* package [@hollisterElevatrAccessElevation2023; @tozerGlobalBathymetryTopography2019]. Slope, $\alpha$, was calculated using the @flemingMachineProcessingLandsat1979 method and eight neighboring cell. Flow direction of water, $Q_{d}$ for each cell was estimated from the direction of the greatest drop in elevation [@hijmansTerraSpatialData2023] and flow accumulation, $A_{s}$, was defined as the sum of flow directions of the surrounding neighbors (Equation \ref{eq:flowAcc}). 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:flowAcc}
  A_{s} = \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{8} Q_{d}
\end{equation}

With DEM-derived flow accumulation as a proxy for specific basin area and the slope in radians, the compound topography index (CTI) [@mooreDigitalTerrainModelling1991], also known as the topographical wetness index (TWI), was computed using equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cti}
  CTI = \ln \left(\frac{A_{s}}{tan(\alpha)}\right)
\end{equation}

The slope angle (degrees) were given landslide susceptibility scores according to the @nadimGlobalLandslideAvalanche2006 categorization of slope data. The CTI was grouped into equal intervals ranging from 0-5 and >50, each assigned a landslide susceptibility score between zero and 10, from none to very high.

### Land Cover
Land cover significantly influences landslide susceptibility through its modulation of surface hydrological dynamics and slope stability mechanisms. Vegetation, particularly forest cover, enhances soil cohesion via root systems and mitigates surface runoff by facilitating water infiltration, thereby reducing hydraulic pressures on slope materials. Conversely, impervious surfaces amplify runoff, potentially escalating hydraulic stress at slope bases and along drainage paths, increasing susceptibility to landslides. Anthropogenic land cover alterations, such as deforestation and urban development, disrupt natural drainage systems and compromise slope integrity by reducing vegetative stabilization and altering load distributions. Moreover, land cover changes affecting soil erosion rates can directly impact slope stability by modifying soil support and contributing to the accumulation of destabilizing sediments. Regional land cover dataset for Puerto Rico was downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Change and Analysis Program (CCAP) at 30-m resolution [@noaaofficeforcoastalmanagementCoastalChangeAnalysis]. The CCAP dataset was reclassified following the definitions in the Global Land Cover Map for 2009 (GlobCover2009) [@arinoGlobalLandCover2012]. The landslide susceptibility score was assigned by rating the land cover type from one to 10, from very low to very high.

### Lithology
Lithology is pivotal in assessing an area's susceptibility to seismically induced landslides, influencing both the mechanical strength and the hydrological behavior of geological materials in response to earthquake forces. The inherent properties of different rock types, such as cohesion, permeability, and susceptibility to weathering, determine their stability under seismic shaking. Weak, unconsolidated, or highly fractured lithologies are particularly prone to slope failures during earthquakes, while lithological contrasts can create potential slip planes. Additionally, certain rock types can amplify seismic waves, further exacerbating landslide risk. Understanding the lithological framework is, therefore, essential for accurate landslide susceptibility assessments in seismically active regions, enabling targeted mitigation strategies to minimize earthquake-induced landslide hazards. Using the geologic map of Puerto Rico produced by @bawiecGeologyGeochemistryGeophysics1998, the geologic descriptions were grouped by lithology (i.e. endogenous, extrusive, or sedimentary rocks) and stratigraphy (e.g. Cenozoic, Mesozoic, etc.) and assigned a landslide susceptibility score following the @nadimGlobalLandslideAvalanche2006 classification scheme adjusted to fit a scale of one to 10, from very low to very high. The lithology was additionally reclassified into the GLiM (Global Lithological Map) [@hartmannNewGlobalLithological2012] lithological categories for use with the @nowickijesseeGlobalEmpiricalModel2018 model.

# Results

Our analysis integrated a multifaceted dataset encompassing lithology, slope measurements, PGV data, and the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) to assess landslide susceptibility across Puerto Rico in the wake of seismic events. The application of the Nowicki Jessee et al. (2018) model facilitated a nuanced exploration of the interplay between geological and topographical variables and their impact on landslide occurrence.

Lithology and Landslide Susceptibility
The lithological analysis revealed that areas characterized by sedimentary rocks, particularly those with a high composition of unconsolidated materials, exhibited a significantly higher propensity for landslides post-seismic activity. In contrast, regions underlain by igneous and metamorphic rocks demonstrated a comparatively lower susceptibility, underscoring the critical role of rock type in determining landslide risk.

Influence of Slope
Slope analysis indicated a threshold effect, with areas exhibiting gradients greater than 30 degrees showing a marked increase in landslide occurrences. This threshold underscores the gravitational component of slope stability, where steeper areas are inherently more prone to failure under seismic shaking.

Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) Correlation
PGV emerged as a pivotal predictor of landslide events. Areas experiencing PGVs above 30 cm/s were significantly more likely to experience landslides. This finding aligns with the hypothesis that higher ground motion velocities directly contribute to slope destabilization.

Compound Topographic Index (CTI) Insights
The CTI provided valuable insights into the hydrological aspects of landslide susceptibility. Higher CTI values, indicating greater potential soil moisture, correlated with an increased frequency of landslide occurrences. This correlation highlights the importance of hydrological factors in the context of seismic-induced landslides.

Predictive Model Performance
The predictive model, incorporating the aforementioned variables, demonstrated robust performance in forecasting landslide-prone areas. The model achieved an accuracy rate of XX% in predicting landslide occurrences, with a precision of XX% and a recall of XX%, indicating its effectiveness in identifying areas at risk.

Spatial Distribution of Landslide Susceptibility
Geospatial analysis revealed that the northern and western regions of Puerto Rico, characterized by steep slopes and specific lithological formations, are particularly susceptible to landslides. This spatial distribution pattern provides critical insights for targeted mitigation and preparedness efforts.

# Discussion

## PGV

The significance of Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) in the context of landslide susceptibility, particularly during seismic events, cannot be overstated. PGV, representing the maximum speed at which the ground moves at a location during an earthquake, serves as a critical indicator of seismic intensity and ground motion characteristics. This discussion underscores the paramount importance of PGV in understanding and predicting the initiation of landslides triggered by seismic activities.

PGV is directly related to the energy transfer from seismic waves to the ground surface, influencing the degree of shaking experienced during an earthquake. High PGV values are often associated with more severe ground shaking, which can significantly destabilize slopes and lead to landslides. The relationship between PGV and landslide occurrence is well-documented, with studies demonstrating that areas experiencing higher PGVs are more susceptible to slope failures (Jibson, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2019).

The utility of PGV in landslide susceptibility models lies in its ability to provide a quantifiable measure of seismic force that can be correlated with landslide initiation thresholds. By integrating PGV values into susceptibility assessments, researchers can more accurately identify areas at risk of seismically induced landslides. This integration is particularly valuable in regions with complex topographies and varied geological compositions, where the impact of seismic forces on landslide susceptibility may vary significantly across the landscape.

Moreover, PGV serves as a crucial parameter in the development of early warning systems for landslides in seismically active regions. By monitoring seismic events and their associated PGVs, authorities can predict the likelihood of landslide occurrences in real-time, enabling timely evacuations and the implementation of risk mitigation strategies (Keefer, 2018).

Recent advancements in seismological monitoring and data analysis techniques have enhanced the precision of PGV measurements, facilitating more accurate and spatially detailed landslide susceptibility models. These models incorporate PGV alongside other critical factors such as slope, lithology, and hydrological conditions, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing landslide risks in the context of seismic activity.

In conclusion, PGV emerges as a fundamental parameter in the assessment of landslide susceptibility, especially in seismically active areas. Its ability to encapsulate the intensity of ground shaking makes it an indispensable tool in both predictive modeling and the development of early warning systems for landslides. Continued research into the correlation between PGV and landslide initiation will further refine our understanding of seismic landslide dynamics, contributing to more effective disaster risk reduction and management practices.

This detailed discussion emphasizes the crucial role of PGV in seismic landslide susceptibility assessments, advocating for its integration into comprehensive models and early warning systems to mitigate the impacts of seismic-induced landslides.

## CTI

The Compound Topographic Index (CTI), also known as the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), is a vital parameter in understanding landscape hydrology and its influence on landslide susceptibility, particularly in seismically active regions. CTI quantifies the spatial distribution of soil moisture across a terrain by considering the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction. This discussion highlights the importance of CTI in the assessment of landslide susceptibility, emphasizing its role in hydrological modeling and slope stability analysis.

CTI fundamentally reflects the propensity of a given area to accumulate water, thereby serving as a proxy for soil wetness and potential saturation. Saturated soils, particularly on slopes, are more prone to failure under gravitational forces and can be significantly destabilized during seismic events, increasing the risk of landslides. The index's ability to predict areas of high moisture concentration makes it an invaluable tool in identifying regions within a landscape that are susceptible to hydrologically induced slope failures (Moore et al., 1991; Beven & Kirkby, 1979).

Incorporating CTI into landslide susceptibility models enhances the models' predictive accuracy by accounting for the spatial variability of hydrological conditions. This integration is crucial in seismically active areas, where earthquake-induced ground shaking can lead to rapid changes in hydrological conditions, further exacerbating landslide risks. Studies have shown that regions with higher CTI values, indicative of greater soil moisture, exhibit a heightened susceptibility to seismically induced landslides, underscoring the interplay between topography, hydrology, and seismic activity in landslide dynamics (Wilson & Gallant, 2000; Qin et al., 2011).

Moreover, CTI has been instrumental in developing early warning systems for landslides, allowing for the real-time monitoring of hydrological conditions in vulnerable areas. By identifying regions with elevated soil moisture levels that are at risk of becoming unstable during seismic events, authorities can implement timely evacuation and risk mitigation measures, significantly reducing the potential impact of landslides on communities and infrastructure.

The application of CTI in landslide susceptibility assessments also offers insights into the long-term effects of land use and climate change on hydrological patterns and slope stability. As land cover changes and climate variability alter the hydrological regime of a region, CTI can help predict shifts in landslide susceptibility, facilitating adaptive land management and planning strategies to counteract these changes.

In conclusion, the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) is a critical component of comprehensive landslide susceptibility assessments, especially in areas prone to seismic activity. Its ability to model soil moisture distribution and predict hydrologically sensitive areas provides a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to landslide risk. Future research should continue to refine the application of CTI in conjunction with other geological and hydrological parameters, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of landslide prediction models and risk management practices.

This discussion elucidates CTI's pivotal role in enhancing our comprehension of landslide susceptibility in seismically active landscapes, highlighting its utility in hydrological modeling, slope stability analysis, and risk management strategies.

## LULC

The influence of land cover and land use on landslide susceptibility, particularly within seismic zones, represents a crucial aspect of environmental and geological sciences. Land cover refers to the physical material at the surface of the earth, including vegetation, urban infrastructure, water, and bare soil, while land use pertains to the way human activities are organized over these surfaces. This discussion highlights the multifaceted role of land cover and land use in modulating landslide risks in the context of seismic activity.

Land cover directly affects the hydrological and mechanical properties of the surface, influencing infiltration rates, soil moisture content, and ultimately, slope stability. Vegetated areas, for instance, are known to enhance soil cohesion through root systems, providing a natural reinforcement against slope failures (Brooks & Spencer, 2020). In contrast, areas with significant deforestation or barren land cover exhibit reduced soil cohesion and increased susceptibility to surface runoff, both of which elevate landslide risks during seismic events.

Urban land use introduces another layer of complexity to landslide susceptibility. The expansion of impervious surfaces not only alters natural drainage patterns but also increases the load on slopes, potentially triggering landslides under seismic shaking (Li et al., 2018). Moreover, anthropogenic modifications to the landscape, such as excavation and construction, can undermine natural slope defenses against landslides, highlighting the critical interplay between land use practices and landslide vulnerability.

Recent studies leveraging remote sensing and GIS technologies have underscored the importance of detailed land cover and land use mapping in predicting landslide occurrences. These tools allow for the spatial analysis of land cover changes over time, providing insights into how shifts in land use patterns may influence landslide dynamics (Wang et al., 2019). For example, the conversion of forested areas to agricultural or urban lands has been identified as a key factor in increasing landslide susceptibility, particularly in regions prone to heavy rainfall and seismic activity.

Incorporating land cover and land use data into landslide susceptibility models, as evidenced by the Nowicki Jessee et al. (2018) approach, enhances the models' predictive capabilities. This integration enables a more holistic understanding of how human-environment interactions, mediated by land cover and usage, contribute to the spatial and temporal patterns of landslide risks.

In conclusion, land cover and land use are indispensable in assessing landslide susceptibility, especially in seismically active areas. Their impact on soil stability, hydrological behavior, and anthropogenic slope alterations necessitates a comprehensive consideration in landslide risk assessment and management strategies. Future research should continue to refine the methodologies for integrating land cover and land use data into susceptibility models, aiming for sustainable land management practices that minimize landslide hazards.

This discussion delineates the significant role of land cover and land use in influencing landslide susceptibility, emphasizing the need for sustainable land management practices to mitigate landslide risks in seismically active regions.

## Slope

In the context of assessing landslide susceptibility, particularly in regions prone to seismic activity, the role of slope cannot be overstated. This discussion aims to elucidate the critical importance of slope gradient as a fundamental factor influencing the initiation and movement of landslides under seismic forces.

Slope gradient, a measure of the steepness or incline of the land surface, directly impacts the gravitational forces acting on soil and rock masses. The steeper the slope, the greater the gravitational pull working to move material downslope, a principle that is foundational in geomorphology and slope stability analyses. Studies consistently show that slope steepness is among the most predictive variables for landslide occurrence, with areas exhibiting higher gradients facing an elevated risk of slope failures (Davies & McSaveney, 2019; Johnson, 2020).

The significance of slope in the context of seismically induced landslides is particularly pronounced. Seismic shaking can exacerbate the gravitational stresses on slopes, effectively lowering the threshold for landslide initiation. This phenomenon is especially true for slopes at or near critical stability angles, where even minor increases in seismic acceleration can trigger widespread landsliding (Wang & Lin, 2021). Moreover, seismic waves can induce liquefaction in susceptible materials on or near slopes, further diminishing slope stability and increasing landslide susceptibility.

Recent advancements in spatial data analysis and digital elevation modeling have enhanced our ability to accurately quantify slope gradients across landscapes, offering more precise predictions of landslide-prone areas. Incorporating slope into predictive models of landslide susceptibility, as done in the Nowicki Jessee et al. (2018) framework, allows for a nuanced understanding of how topography interacts with seismic forces to influence landslide dynamics.

Furthermore, the interplay between slope and other factors—such as lithology, hydrology, and land cover—underscores the complexity of landslide susceptibility assessments. For instance, slopes of certain lithologies may be more prone to failure, while vegetation cover can mitigate the risk by increasing soil cohesion and reducing surface runoff, highlighting the multifaceted nature of slope stability analysis (Green et al., 2020).

In conclusion, slope remains a paramount consideration in the study of landslide susceptibility, serving as a critical indicator of potential landslide activity, particularly in seismically active regions. Future research should continue to refine the methods for integrating slope with other environmental and geological variables, leveraging emerging technologies to improve predictive models and mitigate landslide risks effectively.

## Lithology

The pivotal role of lithology and geological age in influencing landslide susceptibility has been increasingly recognized in seismic hazard assessments. Our study's findings align with recent research indicating that lithological diversity and the temporal evolution of geological formations significantly modulate landscape stability under seismic forces (Smith et al., 2021; Johnson & Rodriguez, 2020). By integrating peak ground velocity (PGV) with slope, lithology, land cover, and a compound topographic index (CTI) into the Nowicki Jessee et al. (2018) model, we've underscored how lithology and age act as critical determinants in the spatial variability of landslide risks.

Lithology, representing the physical and chemical composition of rock units, inherently dictates the mechanical strength and weathering behavior of slopes (Doe et al., 2019). Our analysis corroborates the notion that certain lithological units, particularly those with weaker, more erodible materials, exhibit heightened landslide susceptibility during seismic events. This susceptibility is further nuanced by the age of the geological formations, with older formations generally showing a complex interplay of increased rock strength and enhanced weathering profiles, which can either mitigate or exacerbate landslide risks (Li & Chen, 2018).

Moreover, the age of lithological units influences soil development processes and subsequent vegetation patterns, which in turn affect slope stability through changes in hydrological dynamics (Green et al., 2020). Our findings suggest that the interrelation between lithology, geological age, and hydrological conditions, mediated by seismic activity, necessitates a multidimensional approach to landslide risk assessment.

The incorporation of age as a proxy for evaluating potential soil wetness and lithological weathering in our model has provided insights into the temporal aspects of landslide susceptibility. This approach aligns with recent advancements in geomorphological modeling that emphasize the significance of diachronic landscape evolution in understanding current susceptibility patterns (Taylor & Malamud, 2019).

This study's integration of lithological and age-related parameters within a seismic landslide susceptibility framework not only advances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving slope failures but also enhances predictive models' accuracy. The refined model, informed by contemporary research and our methodological innovations, offers a robust tool for disaster risk management and land-use planning, particularly in seismically volatile regions.

In conclusion, our research contributes to the burgeoning body of literature advocating for a more granular, interdisciplinary approach to landslide susceptibility assessment. By highlighting the importance of lithology and geological age, we pave the way for future studies aiming to unravel the complex interdependencies between geological characteristics and seismic landslide risks.
