  {"id":"atwaterEffects2010Hurricane2014","abstract":"Abstract. A post-hurricane survey of a Caribbean island affords comparisons with geologic evidence for greater overwash at the same place. This comparison, though of limited application to other places, helps calibrate coastal geology for assessment of earthquake and tsunami potential along the Antilles Subduction Zone. The surveyed island, Anegada, is 120 km south of the Puerto Rico Trench and is near the paths of hurricanes Donna (1960) and Earl (2010), which were at or near category 4 when at closest approach. The survey focused on Earl's geologic effects, related them to the surge from Hurricane Donna, and compared them further with erosional and depositional signs of southward overwash from the Atlantic Ocean that dates to 1200–1450 AD and to 1650–1800 AD. The main finding is that the geologic effects of these earlier events dwarf those of the recent hurricanes. Hurricane Earl's geologic effects at Anegada, observed mainly in 2011, were limited to wrack deposition along many of the island's shores and salt ponds, accretion of small washover (spillover) fans on the south shore, and the suspension and deposition of microbial material from interior salt ponds. Earl's most widespread deposit at Anegada, the microbial detritus, was abundantly juxtaposed with evidence for catastrophic overwash in prior centuries. The microbial detritus formed an extensive coating up to 2 cm thick that extended into breaches in beach-ridge plains of the island's north shore, onto playas that are underlain by a sand-and-shell sheet that extends as much as 1.5 km southward from the north shore, and among southward-strewn limestone boulders pendant to outcrops as much as 1 km inland. Earl's spillover fans also contrast with a sand-and-shell sheet, which was dated previously to 1650–1800, by being limited to the island's south shore and by extending inland a few tens of meters at most. These findings complement those reported in this issue by Michaela Spiske and Robert Halley (Spiske and Halley, 2014), who studied a coral-rubble ridge that lines part of Anegada's north shore. Spiske and Halley attribute the ridge to storms that were larger than Earl. But they contrast the ridge with coral boulders that were scattered hundreds of meters inland by overwash in 1200–1450.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Atwater","given":"B.

  {"id":"chuaTsunamiDamagePorts2021","abstract":"Modern tsunami events have highlighted the vulnerability of port structures to these high-impact but infrequent occurrences. However, port planning rarely includes adaptation measures to address tsunami hazards. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami presented us with an opportunity to characterise the vulnerability of port industries to tsunami impacts. Here, we provide a spatial assessment and photographic interpretation of freely available data sources. Approximately 5000 port structures were assessed for damage and stored in a database. Using the newly developed damage database, tsunami damage is quantiﬁed statistically for the ﬁrst time, through the development of damage fragility functions for eight common port industries. In contrast to tsunami damage fragility functions produced for buildings from an existing damage database, our fragility functions showed higher prediction accuracies (up to 75 % accuracy). Pre-tsunami earthquake damage was also assessed in this study and was found to inﬂuence overall damage assessment. The damage database and fragility functions for port industries can inform structural improvements and mitigation plans for ports against future events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chua","given":"Constance Ting"},{"family":"Switzer","given":"Adam D."},{"family":"Suppasri","given":"Anawat"},{"family":"Li","given":"Linlin"},{"family":"Pakoksung","given":"Kwanchai"},{"family":"Lallemant","given":"David"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Susanna F."},{"family":"Charvet","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Chua","given":"Terence"},{"family":"Cheong","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Winspear","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"chuaTsunamiDamagePorts2021","container-title":"Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"huiRiskAssessmentTsunamis2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            China’s coastal areas are densely populated, economically developed, and located in close proximity to several potential tsunami sources; therefore, tsunami risk cannot be ignored. This study assessed tsunami risk in coastal areas of China by developing a framework for tsunami risk assessment from the perspectives of hazards, vulnerability, and exposure. First, a probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) model was applied to estimate the potential tsunami sources in both local crustal faults and circum-Pacific subduction zones based on numerical simulations. The output of the PTHA includes tsunami wave height distributions along the coast. Then, an indicator system reflecting exposure and vulnerability to tsunamis in the coastal areas of China was established by using the entropy method and analytic hierarchy process. The PTHA findings show that the tsunami wave height is close to 3 m on the southern coast of the Bohai Sea, the Pearl River Estuary, and the Yangtze River Delta and exceeds 2 m near the Taiwan Strait for the 2000-year return period. The results of the tsunami risk assessment show that the cities at the highest risk level (level I) include Tangshan, Yantai, and Hong Kong, while cities at the high risk level (level II) include Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou near the Taiwan Strait and many cities on the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Estuary, and the southern coast of the Bohai Sea. Our findings can provide an understanding of differences in tsunami risk between Chinese coastal cities that may be affected by tsunamis in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Chun"},{"family":"Ning","given":"Lixin"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Changxiu"}],"citation-key":"huiRiskAssessmentTsunamis2022","container-title":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Science","container-title-short":"Int J Disaster Risk Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s13753-022-00407-4","ISSN":"2095-0055, 2192-6395","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4]]},"language":"en","page":"275-290","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Risk Assessment of Tsunamis Along the Chinese Coast Due to Earthquakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13753-022-00407-4","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"oloughlinCaribbeanTsunamis500year2003","abstract":"\"In the past 500 years, the Caribbean region has had devastating tsunamis causing incalculable damage. It is an area of relatively high seismicity, and although tsunamis are not the chief natural hazard, they have the potential to produce catastrophic regional disasters.\" \"Today the necessity for awareness is of paramount importance. Tectonic forces continually build stress - until the inevitable release of strain that may trigger a tsunamigenic earthquake. The lack of a major tsunami in the past 57 years is due to a relative lack of relief of built-up energy, and the potential extent of the stress release grows as time elapses. The long period without relief of seismic stress buildup only increases the ominous threat of a devastating tsunami that could result from a sudden seafloor cataclysm.\" \"Caribbean Tsunamis - A 500-Year History from 1498-1998 broadly characterizes the nature of tsunamis in the Caribbean Sea, while bearing in mind both scientific aspects as well as potential interest by the many governments and populations likely to be affected by the hazard. Comprehension of the nature of tsunamis and past effects is crucial for the awareness and education of populations at risk.\" \"Audience: This book provides a thorough, yet highly accessible review of tsunamis in the Caribbean. It is of interest not only to tsunami and natural hazards specialists at academia and governmental institutes, but also to policy makers and to the general public.\"--Back cover","author":[{"family":"O'Loughlin","given":"Karen Fay"},{"family":"Lander","given":"James F."}],"citation-key":"oloughlinCaribbeanTsunamis500year2003","event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-0321-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 861705619","number-of-pages":"pp 263","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Caribbean tsunamis: a 500-year history from 1498-1998","title-short":"Caribbean tsunamis","type":"book"},
  {"id":"pattiaratchiInfluenceOceanTopography2020","abstract":"Western Australia is susceptible to tsunamis from seismic sources that originate from distant sources including the Sunda Arc. Many surface and subsurface topographic ocean features are located between the Australian continent and locations where tsunamigenic earthquakes occur. These include the Venin Meinesz Seamounts (including Christmas Island) and Horizon Ridge, Exmouth, Zenith and Cuvier Plateaus. Numerical simulations of idealised tsunamigenic earthquakes along the Sunda Arc revealed that these topographic features have a large influence on the distribution of tsunami heights, propagating speeds and energy distribution. The interaction between tsunami waves and Venin Meinesz Seamounts and Horizon Ridge, located close to the earthquake locations, scatter the tsunami energy into several beams. Exmouth Plateau acts as a focusing feature to increase wave heights between North West Cape and Barrow Island whilst Cuvier Plateau deflects energy towards Shark Bay. Although Zenith Plateau has a local effect, it does not influence tsunami waves along the coast. Southwest Australia is “sheltered” from the direct effect of tsunami waves from Sunda Arc due to the combined effects of the Seamounts and Cuvier Plateau in the scattering and refraction of tsunami waves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pattiaratchi","given":"Charitha"}],"citation-key":"pattiaratchiInfluenceOceanTopography2020","container-title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","container-title-short":"JMSE","DOI":"10.3390/jmse8090629","ISSN":"2077-1312","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,19]]},"language":"en","page":"629","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Influence of Ocean Topography on Tsunami Propagation in Western Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/8/9/629","volume":"8"},
